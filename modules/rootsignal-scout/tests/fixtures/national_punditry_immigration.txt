The Immigration Debate We're Not Having

Opinion | By Charles Whitfield | National Review Online | February 19, 2026

The Biden administration's immigration policies created a crisis. The Trump administration's enforcement policies are creating a different kind of crisis. And neither side wants to have an honest conversation about trade-offs.

The reality is that mass deportation on the scale being attempted is logistically impossible, economically destructive, and morally questionable. At the same time, an open-borders approach — which some progressive activists effectively advocate for, even if they don't use those words — is politically untenable and practically unworkable.

What we need is a grand bargain: robust border enforcement combined with a generous legal immigration system and a realistic pathway for the millions already here. This is essentially what George W. Bush proposed in 2007 and what the Gang of Eight nearly achieved in 2013.

Instead, we get performative cruelty from one side and performative compassion from the other. ICE raids in Minneapolis make for great cable news footage, but they don't actually solve the underlying problem. Sanctuary city policies make activists feel righteous, but they don't address the legitimate concerns of communities dealing with rapid demographic change.

The American people deserve better than this kabuki theater. They deserve leaders willing to tell uncomfortable truths to their own bases.
