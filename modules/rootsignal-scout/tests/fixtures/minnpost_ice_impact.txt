Have things changed since the end of Operation Metro Surge?

Has Minnesota's level of cooperation with ICE changed since the end of Operation Metro Surge? "There have been no widespread policy changes at the state or local level to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)," according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. However, some law enforcement officials say that communication is improving.

The operation doesn't seem to be winding down for some Minnesota educators. MPR News has a story on Fridley Public Schools Superintendent Brenda Lewis, who still sees ICE activity that "continues to interrupt daily life for students, staff and families in Fridley and other districts with high concentrations of immigrant kids."

Lewis told MPR that attendance dropped 15% in the weeks following Operation Metro Surge, and that some families have not returned. "We have kids who were doing well academically who just disappeared," Lewis said. "Their parents pulled them out of fear."

"People tracking ICE have reported significantly less federal immigration enforcement activity, though reports of ICE activity continue," The Minnesota Reformer reports. "Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said during a Wednesday press conference that ICE 'continues to terrorize' community members. Sahan Journal reported that people observing ICE are finding that agents use increasingly covert tactics — including reports of agents going door-to-door pretending to be environmental canvassers — to continue operations across Twin Cities suburbs."

The Fridley school district has set up a family resource center at Fridley Community Center, 6085 7th Street NE, Fridley, MN 55432, offering:
- Immigration legal consultations (Tuesdays, 4-7 PM)
- Mental health support for children and families
- Emergency food assistance
- Connection to housing resources

The resource center is open to all families regardless of district enrollment. Contact: 763-502-5000

Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Public Schools board voted Tuesday to reaffirm its sanctuary schools policy, directing staff not to share student immigration information with federal authorities and prohibiting ICE from entering school buildings without a judicial warrant.
