Thread from @PatriotEagle2024:

The whole "sanctuary city" thing in Minneapolis is a JOKE. These people broke the law coming here and now we're supposed to feel sorry for them? Deport them all. Law and order means something. #MAGA #DeportThemAll

Reply from @ResistMN:

Actually, immigrants commit fewer crimes than natural-born citizens. This is just racism dressed up as law enforcement. The real criminals are the corporations exploiting immigrant labor while lobbying for their deportation. Wake up. #AbolishICE #NoBanNoWall

Reply from @CentristDad42:

Both sides are being ridiculous. We need comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border AND provides a pathway to citizenship. Neither party wants to actually solve this because the outrage is too useful for fundraising.

Thread from @HousingJusticeNow:

THREAD: Why the Minneapolis 2040 plan failed and why neoliberal housing policy will NEVER solve the affordability crisis. 🧵 (1/23)

1/ The fundamental problem is that housing has been commodified. Until we decommodify housing entirely, every market-based "solution" is just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

2/ Upzoning doesn't work. Study after study shows that new market-rate construction doesn't lower rents for existing residents. It's trickle-down economics for housing.

3/ The only real solution is massive public investment in social housing, rent control, and community land trusts. Everything else is a distraction.

Post from @FreedomFighter_US:

Minneapolis is what happens when Democrats run a city for 50 years. Crime through the roof, businesses leaving, schools failing. But sure, keep voting blue. How's that working out for you? The rest of America is watching and taking notes.
