Southwest Journal: Parents Rally Against Proposed School Closures in Southwest Minneapolis

By Jessica Huang | Southwest Journal | February 20, 2026

More than 300 parents packed the auditorium at Justice Page Middle School Wednesday night to protest Minneapolis Public Schools' plan to close three elementary schools in Southwest Minneapolis as part of the district's "Comprehensive District Design" reorganization.

The schools slated for closure — Armatage, Kenny, and Windom — serve approximately 900 students combined. The district says declining enrollment and a $100 million budget shortfall make the closures necessary.

But parents say the closures will devastate tight-knit neighborhood communities that depend on walkable schools.

"My kids walk four blocks to Armatage," said parent and Armatage neighborhood resident David Osman. "If this school closes, they'll be bused to Burroughs, which is 2.5 miles away. We moved here specifically for this school."

The district's plan would consolidate students into fewer, larger buildings. Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams says the remaining schools would have more resources per student.

Parent organizers have formed "Save Southwest Schools," which has collected over 2,000 petition signatures in two weeks. The group is planning:

- Rally at MPS headquarters: Wednesday, March 5, 4:30 PM, 1250 W Broadway Ave
- Community forum with school board members: Saturday, March 8, 2:00 PM, Armatage Community Center, 2500 W 57th St
- Door-knocking campaign: Every Saturday through March, meet at Kenny Park, 1610 W 44th St, 10:00 AM

School board members Julia Samuelson (District 6) and Collin Beachy (At-Large) have expressed reservations about the timeline, asking for more community input before the April vote.

The final school board vote is scheduled for April 15. Public comment at board meetings is available — sign up at mpls.k12.mn.us/board-meetings.
