The construction on Nostrand Ave has been going since 5:30 AM every day this week. I know the city allows it starting at 7 AM but this is way earlier. Has anyone had luck getting DOB to actually respond to noise complaints?

Call 311 and file a noise complaint. You need to document the times — take videos with timestamps. I had the same issue on Franklin Ave and after about 10 complaints from different residents they actually sent an inspector.

The DOB complaint portal is also online: nyc.gov/311. Select "Noise — Construction Before/After Allowed Hours."

Same developer (Elan Group) doing the same thing on Rogers Ave. They got fined $2,500 last month for before-hours work but they just pay it and keep going. The fine is nothing compared to what they save by working extra hours.

The community board (CB9) is collecting testimony about construction noise for their next meeting on April 14 at 6:30 PM at the Crown Heights Library. They're trying to get the city to increase fines specifically in this area because of the volume of development.

If you've been affected, email your written complaint to cb9@cb.nyc.gov before April 10.

For anyone dealing with this at night or on weekends too — NYC has quiet hours from 10 PM to 7 AM weekdays and all day Sunday. If they're violating that, the NYPD can respond (not just DOB).

Also, the Crown Heights Tenant Union has been organizing around construction impacts. They meet Tuesdays at 7 PM at 734 Nostrand Ave. @CHTenantUnion on IG.
