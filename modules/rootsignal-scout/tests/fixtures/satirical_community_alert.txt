BREAKING: City of Minneapolis Declares War on Potholes

In a stunning reversal, Mayor Jenkins announced today that the city will be "deploying an elite tactical unit" to combat the pothole menace plaguing South Minneapolis.

"We've tried diplomacy," Jenkins told reporters while standing next to an 18-inch crater on Chicago Ave. "The potholes have rejected our peace offerings. It's time for direct action."

The "Pothole Rapid Response Force" — which is definitely not just three guys in a truck with asphalt — will begin operations "sometime around never, if past experience is any guide," according to City Council Member Sarah Chen, who could not stop laughing during the press conference.

Residents are encouraged to report potholes at 311, where their complaints will be carefully filed in the same circular filing cabinet as always.

In related news, a GoFundMe titled "Buy Lake Street Its Own Suspension Bridge" has raised $47 from 3 donors. Organizer Dave Peterson notes, "At this rate, we'll have enough for one bag of cold patch by 2045."

The Powderhorn Community Association released a statement saying they "appreciate the mayor's sense of humor" and would like to remind residents that their annual Pothole Appreciation Walk is NOT a real event, despite what was posted on Nextdoor.

Contact the city's pothole hotline at 612-555-HOLE (not a real number).
