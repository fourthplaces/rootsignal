Two different sources report conflicting details for what appears to be the same event:
- Date: July 12 (Saturday) vs. July 13 (Sunday)
- Time: 2-5 PM vs. 1-4 PM
- Location: Outdoors at the lake vs. indoors at the recreation center
- The park association's own newsletter says Saturday outdoor; the newspaper says Sunday indoor
