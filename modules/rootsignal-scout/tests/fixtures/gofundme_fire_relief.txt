# Help the Martinez Family After Apartment Fire — GoFundMe

**Organized by Sarah Chen on behalf of the Martinez family**

$4,230 raised of $15,000 goal | 67 donors | Created March 29, 2026

---

On March 27, a fire broke out in the apartment building at 2847 Bloomington Ave S, Minneapolis, displacing four families including the Martinez family — parents Jorge and Elena and their three children (ages 4, 7, and 11).

The fire destroyed most of their belongings including clothing, school supplies, and Elena's sewing equipment which she used for her home alteration business.

The Red Cross has provided temporary housing for 30 days, but the family needs help getting back on their feet.

## What the funds will cover:
- First/last month rent + deposit for new apartment: ~$4,500
- Replacement clothing and school supplies for the kids: ~$1,500
- Replacement sewing machine and supplies for Elena's business: ~$2,000
- Groceries and essentials for the first month: ~$1,000
- Emergency buffer: ~$6,000

## Other ways to help:
- **Clothing donations:** The kids wear sizes 4T, 7, and 12. Drop off at Calvary Lutheran Church, 3901 Chicago Ave (Mon-Fri 9-5)
- **Meals:** Sign up at mealtrain.com/martinez-family-mpls to bring a meal to the temporary housing
- **Job leads:** Elena is looking for alteration/tailoring work. Jorge does construction and landscaping. Contact sarah.chen.mpls@gmail.com

The family attends Calvary Lutheran and their kids go to Bancroft Elementary. They've been part of the Powderhorn neighborhood for 8 years.

All funds go directly to the Martinez family. I'm a neighbor and friend — happy to answer any questions.
