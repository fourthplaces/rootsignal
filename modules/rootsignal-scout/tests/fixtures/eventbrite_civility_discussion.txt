Civility & Peace Discussion Evening

Date: Thursday, March 12, 2026 | 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM CDT

Location: Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403

An evening of discussion, food, drink and fun all in the name of building community and sharing ideas in the Twin Cities.

Recent episodes of political violence have left many wondering what kind of civic life we are entering. As distrust rises and Americans grow more distant from one another, what are the prospects for civility and peace?

What holds a society together when disagreement deepens? And what happens when those bonds begin to fray?

Join us for a moderated discussion with:
- Dr. Amara Okafor, University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs
- Pastor Miguel Santos, Sagrado Corazón Church
- Sarah Chen, Minnesota Council of Nonprofits

Light dinner provided by World Street Kitchen. Cash bar available.

This event is part of the "Better Together MN" series, a monthly gathering that brings together people from different backgrounds and viewpoints to practice the kind of conversation our democracy needs.

Previous events have drawn 80-120 attendees from across the metro area.
