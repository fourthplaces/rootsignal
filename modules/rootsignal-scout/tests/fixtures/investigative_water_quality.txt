# MPCA Issues Advisory After Elevated PFAS Levels Found in South Minneapolis Wells

*MinnPost | April 2, 2026*

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) issued a drinking water advisory Tuesday after routine testing revealed elevated levels of PFAS compounds in three monitoring wells in the Phillips and Powderhorn neighborhoods of south Minneapolis.

The levels — measured at 45-78 parts per trillion (ppt) for combined PFAS — exceed the state's Health Risk Limit of 35 ppt but remain below the EPA's federal advisory level of 70 ppt.

## What residents should know

The affected wells are monitoring wells, not active drinking water sources. Minneapolis drinking water comes from the Mississippi River and is treated at the Fridley filtration plant, which has activated carbon filtration that removes PFAS.

However, the MPCA is advising residents in the affected area who have private wells (uncommon but not unheard of in south Minneapolis) to get their water tested immediately.

**Free testing** is available through the Minnesota Department of Health at health.state.mn.us/pfas or by calling 651-201-4700.

## Community meeting

The MPCA and Minneapolis Health Department will hold a public information session:

**Thursday, April 10, 2026 | 6:30 - 8:00 PM**
Phillips Community Center, 2323 11th Ave S, Minneapolis

Staff will present testing results, answer questions, and provide take-home water testing kits.

## Background

The contamination is believed to be linked to historical use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at a former industrial site on East 28th Street. The MPCA has identified the site as a priority for its PFAS Action Plan and is working with the property owner on remediation.

"We want to be transparent about what we're finding," said MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler. "The risk to residents on city water is very low, but we take any PFAS detection seriously."

Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez, whose Ward 9 includes parts of the affected area, called for an accelerated cleanup timeline and expanded testing radius.

"Families in Phillips and Powderhorn deserve the same urgency we'd see if this were happening in Edina or Wayzata," Chavez said.
