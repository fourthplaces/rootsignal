Masjid An-Nur Open House & Interfaith Dialogue

Saturday, March 15, 2026 | 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM

Masjid An-Nur, 1729 Lyndale Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55411

In the wake of rising Islamophobic incidents across the Twin Cities — including vandalism at two mosques in Brooklyn Park and verbal harassment reported at several community businesses along Central Ave — Masjid An-Nur is hosting an open house and interfaith dialogue.

"Fear and misunderstanding are rising on all sides," says Imam Hassan Jama. "The best antidote we know is to open our doors, share a meal, and get to know each other as neighbors."

The afternoon includes:
- Guided tours of the mosque (ongoing, no appointment needed)
- Panel: "Being Muslim in Minneapolis in 2026" — personal stories from community members
- Interfaith prayer and reflection (leaders from 6 faith traditions)
- Somali tea and East African food prepared by community members
- Kids' activities and henna art

Co-sponsored by:
- Minneapolis Area Synod (ELCA)
- Jewish Community Action
- Minnesota Council of Churches
- Northside Residents Redevelopment Council

Free and open to all. No registration required.

Note: A prayer space is available for those who wish to participate in Dhuhr (afternoon) prayer at 1:30 PM. Modest dress is appreciated but not required — scarves available at the entrance for those who wish to cover.
