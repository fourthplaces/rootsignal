**r/Minneapolis: Another rent increase — 3rd year in a row. Where is everyone moving?**

Just got the renewal letter. $1,850 to $2,100 for a 1BR in Uptown. That's a 13% increase. Last year it went up 10%. My income has gone up maybe 3%.

I know I'm not alone in this. My building used to be mostly long-term tenants and now it feels like a revolving door. The management company (Hornig) just renovates units as people leave and jacks up the rent another $200.

Is anyone actually staying in Uptown at these prices? Where are people going?

Same thing happening in Northeast. My 2BR on Central Ave went from $1,400 to $1,650. The building was bought by some LLC last year and they immediately started "capital improvements" (new lobby furniture, a package locker nobody asked for) to justify the increase.

Check if your building is covered under the new Minneapolis rent stabilization ordinance. If it was built before 2004 and has 10+ units, increases over 8% need 90-day notice and you can contest them.

The tenant hotline at HOME Line (612-728-5767) is really helpful. They walked me through my rights and even sent a template letter to my landlord. Free service.

Also the city's 311 service can connect you to the Office of Tenant Protection if you think the increase is retaliatory.

PSA: Minneapolis Highrise Representative Council is having a meeting about this on April 8 at 6pm, Central Library downtown. They're organizing a coalition response to the wave of increases.

Also Inquilinxs Unidxs (United Renters) does direct action organizing if you want to get involved: iu.org

FYI there's a list of income-restricted apartments on the HousingLink website (housinglink.org). Wait lists are long but some open up. Also check Aeon, CommonBond, and PPL — they all have below-market units.

I moved to Saint Paul last year. Same commute on the Green Line, rent is $400/month less for a comparable unit. Not saying Minneapolis shouldn't fix this, but if you need relief now, look across the river.

The irony is the city approved 3,500 new units last year and rents still went up. The new construction is all luxury. We need policy that preserves existing affordable stock, not just builds more $2,000 studios.

Just want to add: if you're facing an increase you literally cannot afford, don't just leave quietly. File a complaint with 311 (option 3). The city tracks this data and it feeds into policy decisions. The more complaints on record, the stronger the case for enforcement.
