3. Text location details to the Rapid Response number: (612) 555-0199
4. Note vehicle descriptions, badge numbers if visible, and number of agents

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS:
- You have the right to remain silent

- ICE administrative warrants (Form I-200) do NOT authorize entry into your home
- You have the right to speak to a lawyer

Legal support is available through the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC) at (612) 555-0234.

Community Safe Spaces:
