Whittier Neighborhood Safety Walk & Community Forum

Posted by Whittier Alliance | February 18, 2026

After a series of car break-ins and a mugging near Blaisdell Ave and 26th Street last month, residents have been asking what can be done. The Whittier Alliance is organizing a neighborhood safety walk followed by a community forum to discuss next steps.

SAFETY WALK
Saturday, March 8, 2026 | 10:00 AM
Meet at: Whittier Park, 425 W 26th St, Minneapolis, MN 55405

We'll walk the neighborhood together, identifying areas with poor lighting, blind corners, and other environmental factors that affect safety. MPD Community Crime Prevention Specialist Officer Tanya Washington will join us.

COMMUNITY FORUM
Saturday, March 8, 2026 | 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
Whittier Park Recreation Center (same location)

Agenda:
- MPD 5th Precinct update on recent incidents
- Presentation from Whittier Alliance on crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
- Discussion: What kind of safety do we want? (This is NOT a "more police vs. fewer police" debate — we want to hear concrete ideas from people who live here)
- Breakout groups by block cluster

Lunch provided. Childcare available — please RSVP so we can plan.

"We've heard from a lot of residents who feel less safe but don't know what to do about it," says Whittier Alliance Executive Director Kayla Thompson. "This isn't about politics. It's about neighbors figuring out what works for our specific blocks."
