# Community Gardens Gear Up for Growing Season Across South Minneapolis

*Southwest Journal | March 28, 2026*

As the snow melts, neighborhood gardens across south Minneapolis are preparing for another growing season, with several hosting volunteer days to kick things off.

Powderhorn Community Garden, one of the city's oldest community plots, will hold its annual spring volunteer day on April 12. Organizers expect around 50 volunteers to help prepare the garden's 45 raised beds for planting.

"We're especially focused on expanding our East African and Southeast Asian crop sections this year," said Maria Gonzalez, garden coordinator for the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association. "Last year we grew 2,000 pounds of produce, and about a third went directly to neighborhood food shelves."

The event runs from 9 AM to 1 PM at the garden on 15th Avenue South, with food provided by local vendors.

Meanwhile, the Kingfield neighborhood will host a similar event on April 19, and Lyndale Garden Club has scheduled its spring cleanup for April 5.

The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, which provides land and water access for many community gardens, recently expanded its community garden program to include five new sites on the north side.
