## Rules

- NEVER write, edit, or delete code unless the user explicitly gives consent. Always explain what you would change first and wait for approval before touching any files.
- Tests MUST follow the pattern: MOCK → FUNCTION → OUTPUT. Set up mocks, call the real function/organ under test, assert the output. Do NOT take code out of context by manually calling internal functions step-by-step — that tests your understanding of the code, not the code itself. The organ does the wiring; tests only check what came out. If code cannot be tested this way (e.g. it takes concrete types instead of traits), refactor the code to make it testable — the testing constraint drives the architecture, not the other way around.
- Test names MUST describe behavior, not implementation. A reader should understand what the system does from the name alone. Good: `blank_author_name_does_not_create_actor`. Bad: `whitespace_only_author_actor_not_created`. Tell a story about the system's behavior, not its plumbing.
