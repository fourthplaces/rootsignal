# Community Engagement Signal Landscape for Root Signal

## The Core Tension

Community engagement isn't a flat list — it's a **multi-dimensional space** where any single issue (say, a new housing development) can simultaneously touch land use, environmental justice, racial equity, economic development, and democratic process. So we need to think about this in two ways: **domains** (what the issue is about) and **engagement types** (how people participate).

---

## Engagement Domains

### 1. Democratic Process & Governance
- Elections (local, state, federal — candidates, ballot measures, judicial races)
- Redistricting / representation
- Public comment periods (city council, planning commission, school board, county board, Met Council)
- Budget processes (participatory budgeting, city/county budget hearings)
- Legislative tracking (bills in progress at state/federal level affecting Twin Cities)
- Appointed boards & commissions (vacancies, applications, decisions)
- Government transparency / open data / FOIA

### 2. Land Use & Development
- Zoning changes and variances
- Comprehensive plan updates (Minneapolis 2040, St. Paul comp plan)
- New development proposals (housing, commercial, mixed-use)
- Historic preservation
- Infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, transit — Blue Line extension, etc.)
- Eminent domain / displacement
- Public space design (parks, plazas, streetscapes)

### 3. Environment & Climate
- Climate action plans (city/county/state level)
- Clean energy transition (solar gardens, building electrification, utility policy)
- Air quality / pollution (industrial sites, traffic corridors)
- Water quality (Mississippi watershed, stormwater, PFAS)
- Urban tree canopy / green infrastructure
- Waste management / composting policy
- Environmental justice (who bears pollution burden)

### 4. Housing & Homelessness
- Affordable housing policy (inclusionary zoning, rent stabilization debates)
- Tenant organizing / tenant protections
- Shelter capacity and encampment policy
- Housing development approvals
- Fair housing / anti-discrimination
- Homeownership programs and barriers

### 5. Transportation & Mobility
- Transit planning (Metro Transit routes, BRT, light rail)
- Bike/pedestrian infrastructure
- Street safety / Vision Zero
- Parking policy
- Transportation equity (who gets served, who doesn't)
- E-scooter/micromobility policy

### 6. Public Safety & Justice
- Policing policy and alternatives (hugely relevant post-2020 in Twin Cities)
- Community safety initiatives (violence interrupters, community-led safety)
- Criminal justice reform (bail, sentencing, reentry)
- Restorative justice programs
- Fire/EMS services
- 911 alternatives (behavioral crisis response)

### 7. Education
- School board decisions
- School funding / levies
- Curriculum decisions
- School closures / consolidations
- Early childhood / Pre-K access
- Higher education policy (U of M governance, community colleges)
- Youth programming

### 8. Health & Wellbeing
- Public health policy (local health department decisions)
- Mental health services access
- Substance use / harm reduction policy
- Food access / food policy councils
- Healthcare facility siting
- Reproductive health access
- Disability access and policy

### 9. Economic & Labor
- Minimum wage / labor standards (Minneapolis $15 min wage, sick leave)
- Worker organizing / union activity
- Small business support policy
- Economic development incentives (TIF districts, subsidies)
- Workforce development
- Gig economy regulation
- Cooperative economy

### 10. Immigration & Refugee
- Sanctuary city policies
- Refugee resettlement support
- Language access in government services
- Immigrant worker protections
- Citizenship/naturalization support
- Cultural community advocacy (Somali, Hmong, Latino, Karen communities — all huge in Twin Cities)

### 11. Racial & Social Equity
- Racial equity policy frameworks (Minneapolis racial equity action plan)
- Reparations discussions
- Indigenous sovereignty / land back (very relevant — Dakota homeland)
- Disparities data and accountability
- Hate crime / bias incident response
- Cultural institutions and representation

### 12. Arts, Culture & Public Life
- Public art policy and commissions
- Cultural district designations
- Arts funding (MRAC, state arts board)
- Creative placemaking
- Library system decisions
- Community media / public access

## Engagement Types (The "How" Layer)

This is the other dimension. For any domain above, community engagement takes different forms:

- **Public hearings & comment periods** — formal government processes
- **Voting & elections** — choosing representatives and deciding ballot questions
- **Organizing & advocacy** — community-driven pressure campaigns
- **Volunteering & service** — direct action (cleanups, tutoring, building)
- **Mutual aid** — community self-provision outside government
- **Participatory planning** — co-design processes
- **Litigation & legal advocacy** — using courts to advance community goals
- **Media & narrative** — community journalism, storytelling, public discourse
- **Direct democracy** — petitions, ballot initiatives, referendums

## The Overlap Problem (and Opportunity)

Consider a single real example:

> **The Blue Line Extension (light rail to Brooklyn Park)**

This simultaneously touches: transportation, land use, housing (displacement fears), racial equity (route serves communities of color), environmental (transit vs. cars), economic development, and democratic process (public comment periods). A resident engaging with this issue is doing community engagement across at least 7 domains at once.

**This is Root Signal's superpower.** Most platforms organize by domain silo. A transportation advocacy org tracks transit. A housing org tracks displacement. Nobody connects them. Root Signal can surface that **one public hearing** is relevant to people who care about any of those domains.

## How This Maps to Root Signal's Architecture

1. **Signals get tagged with multiple domains** — not categorized into one bucket. The graph handles this through edges, not categories.
2. **Engagement type is a separate axis** — "public comment period" is a type that applies across all domains.
3. **The cross-domain connections are the high-value insight** — "this zoning hearing matters to you even though you think of yourself as an 'environment person.'"
4. **Domains are scout guidance, not schema** — the 12 domains above tell scouts what to look for. The graph discovers the connections. Categories emerge from the data, not from a taxonomy.

## What Root Signal Covers

Applying the editorial principles (see `editorial-and-signal-inclusion-principles.md`):

**All signal is first-class.** Root Signal surfaces local reality — what's happening, who's responding, and how to plug in. This includes:

- **Constructive action:** Volunteer opportunities, participation pathways, community-building initiatives, resource sharing
- **Public process:** Public hearings, comment periods, elections, board vacancies, budget processes
- **Tension and response:** When local reality is under stress, the system maps both the tension and every response to it — protests, legal aid, solidarity events, mutual aid, policy advocacy
- **Accountability and transparency:** Government data, voting records, contract data, environmental reports — surfaced as facts connected to the graph
- **Organizing and advocacy:** Community-driven campaigns are signal. The system surfaces them without editorializing about whether the cause is right or wrong

**What stays out of scope:** Raw threat data without community context, partisan endorsements, rumors without provenance, personal disputes, commercial advertising. See the editorial principles for the full inclusion/exclusion framework.
