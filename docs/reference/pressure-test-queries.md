# Root Signal — End-User Pressure Test Queries

These queries simulate what real people in the Twin Cities would actually type or ask. They're organized by signal domain, then layered with cross-domain, edge-case, heat map, and stress-test queries designed to expose gaps.

## 5. Cross-Domain Queries (The Real Stress Test)

These are where Root Signal's value becomes clear — or where it breaks. Real people don't think in signal categories.

- "I want to make a difference in my neighborhood — where do I start?" *(spans all four domains)*
- "What's actually happening in the Frogtown neighborhood right now?" *(community + civic + ecological)*
- "I want to live more sustainably — what can I do locally?" *(ecological + ethical consumption)*
- "My block has a vacant lot — what are the options for it?" *(civic + ecological + community)*
- "I care about environmental justice — who's working on that here?" *(civic + ecological)*
- "How do I support immigrant communities in the metro?" *(community + civic + ethical consumption)*
- "What's happening this weekend that I can bring my kids to?" *(community + ecological + civic)*
- "I want to support local food systems — what does that look like here?" *(ecological + ethical consumption + community)*
- "There's a proposed development that would destroy green space near me — what can I do?" *(civic + ecological)*
- "I want to get off the sidelines — give me everything happening near 55408 this week" *(all domains)*

## 6. Edge Cases & Stress Tests

### Ambiguity Stress
- "Help" *(too vague — what does Root Signal do?)*
- "What's going on?" *(location? topic? timeframe?)*
- "I'm angry about what's happening" *(about what? where?)*
- "Things to do this weekend" *(is this Root Signal's job or event-discovery?)*
- "Where can I volunteer?" *(no location, no skill, no time — how handle underspecification?)*

### Scope Boundary Tests
- "What's a good restaurant near me?" *(pure recommendation, not a signal)*
- "Can you help me file my taxes?" *(service request, not signal)*
- "I need a therapist" *(health need — does Root Signal carry this?)*
- "What's the weather going to be this weekend?" *(clearly out of scope)*
- "Who should I vote for?" *(should surface info, not recommend)*
- "Is my landlord allowed to do this?" *(legal question — surface resources, not advice?)*

### Freshness & Timeliness
- "Is the food shelf on Lake Street still open?" *(requires current data)*
- "Did the community meeting about the stadium already happen?" *(past event awareness)*
- "When does the farmers market season start this year?" *(seasonal, needs current year)*
- "Is the volunteer event tomorrow still on despite the weather?" *(real-time dependency)*
- "Are they still looking for sandbag volunteers or is that over?" *(urgency decay)*

### Hyperlocal Precision
- "What's happening on my block?" *(block-level granularity)*
- "Anything within walking distance of 38th and Chicago?" *(loaded location, culturally significant)*
- "Which ward am I in and what's my council member doing?" *(requires geo-to-civic mapping)*
- "The park two blocks from me is trashed — who's responsible?" *(requires park jurisdiction knowledge)*
- "My specific neighborhood association — when do they meet?" *(micro-local knowledge)*

### Identity & Inclusion
- "I'm undocumented — what's safe for me to participate in?" *(trust and safety critical)*
- "Are there LGBTQ-friendly volunteer orgs?" *(identity-aware matching)*
- "I use a wheelchair — which events are actually accessible?" *(accessibility data)*
- "I don't speak English well — is there anything in Hmong?" *(language access)*
- "I'm a teenager — can I actually show up to these things?" *(age-appropriate filtering)*

### Emotional / Motivation State
- "I feel helpless about climate change — what can I actually do that matters?" *(needs motivation-aware response)*
- "I'm burned out on volunteering — is there something low-effort?" *(intensity matching)*
- "I've been meaning to get involved for years — make it easy for me" *(friction reduction)*
- "Everything feels hopeless politically — is anything actually working?" *(needs signal of efficacy)*
- "I want to do something meaningful, not just performative" *(depth/authenticity filtering)*

### Data Integrity Traps
- "Is this volunteer opportunity legit or a scam?" *(trust signal needed)*
- "The event listing says Saturday but someone told me it was canceled" *(conflict resolution)*
- "This organization has bad reviews — should I still volunteer there?" *(reputation signal)*
- "Two different sources say different times for the same meeting" *(deduplication/accuracy)*
- "This was posted six months ago — is it still relevant?" *(staleness detection)*

## 7. Heat Map Queries

These test whether Root Signal can answer "where" questions at a geographic layer — both where signal is concentrated and where it's missing.

- "Where are there food deserts with no nearby food shelf?"
- "What parts of the metro have no ecological stewardship activity?"
- "Which areas have high need but low community organization presence?"

- "Do low-income areas have fewer volunteer opportunities than wealthy ones?"
- "Which neighborhoods have the highest need-to-resource ratio?"
- "Where is civic engagement lowest relative to the number of decisions being made that affect residents?"

#### Overlay / Intersection Queries (Hardest)
- "Show me where high community need overlaps with low volunteer activity"
- "Where are there environmental hazards but no ecological stewardship?"
- "Which areas have lots of development proposals but low civic participation?"
- "Where is ethical consumption access lowest and poverty highest?"
- "Map food insecurity against food shelf and mutual aid locations"
- "Where are the most underserved areas that also have the most untapped volunteer capacity nearby?"

### Heat Map Edge Cases
- "Is my neighborhood a dead zone for community activity?" *(personal, requires location)*
- "Why is there nothing happening in my area?" *(could be data gap vs. actual gap)*
- "Where should a new organization focus if they want to fill the biggest gap?"
- "If I wanted to start something where it's needed most, where should I go?"
- "Are the gaps because nothing is happening, or because Root Signal doesn't have data there?" *(meta-awareness of data coverage vs. reality)*
