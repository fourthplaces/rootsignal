## How This Maps to Root Signal

These audience archetypes are **not categories the system enforces** — they're lenses that help explain why cross-domain graph connections are the core value proposition.

A person doesn't arrive at Root Signal and select "I am a Housing Advocate." They search for something specific — "rent stabilization hearing this week" — and the graph shows them that the same hearing also connects to zoning, transit, and racial equity. The audience archetypes explain *why* those connections matter to real people.

**For scouts:** Each archetype's cause list is a guide for what signal to look for in a geography. If the graph is thin on "tenant organizing" signal, the Twin Cities is probably underserved — because that archetype exists in large numbers there.

**For query agents:** Understanding audience archetypes helps the synthesis agent generate better answers. A query about "housing near the Blue Line" from someone who also asks about "bike infrastructure" is probably coming from a Transit Rider archetype — the synthesis can emphasize transit-oriented development connections.

**For the cross-domain surprise connections:** These are Root Signal's unique value. Every other platform serves one silo. Root Signal serves the connections between silos. The "surprise connections" listed under each archetype are exactly the edges in the graph that no other system surfaces.
