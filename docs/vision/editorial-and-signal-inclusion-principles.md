# Root Signal — Editorial & Signal Inclusion Principles

This document defines what Root Signal includes, what it excludes, and why. It exists to guide every decision about source ingestion, signal classification, and feature development.

---

## Core Principle

**Root Signal amplifies what communities are building, not what they're defending against.**

Every signal in the platform should answer the question: *"What can I do?"* — never *"What should I fear?"*

Root Signal exists to surface agency, opportunity, and connection. It is not a threat monitor, a crime tracker, or an alert system.

## The Inclusion Test

Before ingesting a source or surfacing a signal, it must pass all three:

**1. Is it actionable?**
Can a person do something constructive with this information? Show up, volunteer, attend, buy, learn, participate, contribute, repair, plant, vote, testify, connect?

**2. Is it affirmative?**
Does it point toward something being built, offered, organized, or created — rather than something being threatened, surveilled, or feared?

**3. Does it build agency?**
Does encountering this signal make someone feel more capable of participating in their community — not more anxious about living in it?

If the answer to any of these is no, the signal doesn't belong in Root Signal.

## What We Include

**Community Needs:** Volunteer opportunities, mutual aid requests, donation drives, meal trains, mentorship programs, skill-sharing, community support networks, resource directories.

**Ecological Stewardship:** Restoration events, tree plantings, river cleanups, citizen science programs, native planting guides, community gardens, rain garden workshops, tool libraries, seed exchanges.

**Civic Engagement:** Public hearings, city council meetings, open comment periods, board and commission openings, neighborhood association meetings, voter registration drives, town halls, participatory budgeting, know-your-rights workshops.

**Ethical Consumption:** Farmers markets, co-ops, local business directories, CSAs, repair events, fix-it clinics, zero-waste resources, buy-nothing groups, secondhand shops, identity-specific business directories, tool lending libraries.

## What We Exclude

**Threat and surveillance data.** ICE sighting trackers, crime maps, sex offender registries, incident reports, police scanner feeds. These create fear, not agency. The response-side resources (legal aid, rights workshops, victim support) are welcome — the threat data itself is not.

**Crisis and emergency alerts.** Amber alerts, severe weather warnings, active shooter notifications, evacuation orders. These are critically important but belong in purpose-built emergency systems, not a community signal platform. Root Signal is not a replacement for 911, emergency management, or public safety infrastructure.

**Partisan political content.** Root Signal surfaces civic process (hearings, meetings, comment periods, ballot information) but never endorses candidates, parties, or positions. "When is the school board meeting and how do I testify" is in scope. "Who you should vote for" is not.

**Rumors, unverified sightings, and crowdsourced threat reports.** If the provenance is "someone reported seeing something," it doesn't meet Root Signal's standard. Signals must trace back to an identifiable organization, government entity, or established community group.

**Personal disputes, complaints, and grievances.** Nextdoor-style neighbor complaints, landlord reviews, business callouts. Root Signal is not a reputation platform. It surfaces what's available, not what's wrong.

**Commercial advertising.** Businesses can appear in Root Signal if they meet ethical consumption criteria (local, cooperative, identity-owned, sustainable, repair-oriented). Paid placement, sponsored listings, and general business promotion are permanently out of scope.

**Health and safety data for its own sake.** Restaurant inspection scores, building code violations, environmental contamination maps. These are important public records but don't answer "what can I do." If an organization is holding a cleanup at a contaminated site — that's the signal. The contamination data alone is not.

## The Gray Zone — How to Handle Edge Cases

Some signals live at the boundary. Here's how to think about them:

**"There's a proposed development that would destroy green space near me."**
The development proposal itself is civic signal — it's a public process with hearings and comment periods. Include the hearing, the comment deadline, and any organized advocacy groups. Don't editorialize about whether the development is good or bad.

**"Eviction rates are high in this neighborhood."**
The statistic alone is not actionable signal. But a renters' rights clinic in that neighborhood, a legal aid org accepting tenants, or a tenant organizing group — those are signal. Lead with the resource, not the problem.

**"The food shelf on Lake Street closed."**
A closure is not actionable signal. But if another food shelf nearby is accepting new clients, or if a mutual aid group has stepped in — surface that. Root Signal shows people where to go, not what they've lost.

**"There's a new homeless encampment near my block."**
Not signal for Root Signal. But organizations offering housing navigation, outreach services, or volunteer opportunities supporting people experiencing homelessness — those are signal.

**Pattern:** When confronted with a problem or negative condition, Root Signal's job is to surface the organized, constructive response to that condition — not the condition itself. The response is the signal.

## Tone Implications

These principles extend beyond data ingestion into how Root Signal presents information:

- Descriptions should be invitational, not alarmist
- Urgency should be about opportunity windows ("public comment closes Friday") not about threats ("they're about to approve this")
- Language should assume the user wants to participate, not that they need to be protected
- Gaps in coverage should be acknowledged honestly, not papered over with fear-based framing

---

## Applying This to Source Decisions

When evaluating a new source for ingestion, use this quick checklist:

| Question | Required Answer |
|---|---|
| Does the source primarily offer opportunities, resources, or pathways to action? | Yes |
| Could the data, if aggregated and mapped, put vulnerable people at risk? | No |
| Does the signal make someone feel more capable of participating? | Yes |
| Is the data traceable to an identifiable organization or public process? | Yes |
| Would surfacing this data in a community platform feel constructive? | Yes |

If any answer doesn't match, the source is either out of scope or needs to be ingested selectively (take the resource listings, skip the threat data).

## This Is a Living Document

As Root Signal grows and encounters new source types and signal categories, these principles should be revisited. The core question never changes: **Does this help someone participate in their community?** If yes, it belongs. If no — no matter how interesting, important, or publicly available the data is — it doesn't.
