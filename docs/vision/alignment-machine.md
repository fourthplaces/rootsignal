# Root Signal — The Alignment Machine

## What This Document Is

This document names something that emerged from the architecture rather than being designed into it. Root Signal was built as a broadcast index — collect signals, make them findable, let communities act. But the structure of what it collects naturally produces something larger: a system that surfaces where life is out of alignment and reflects when alignment is restored.

This wasn't planned. It's a recognition.

## Signals Are Declarations of Alignment State

Every signal type maps to a role in the alignment picture:

| Signal Type | What It Declares |
|---|---|
| `ask` | Something is missing. A gap exists between what a community has and what it needs. |
| `give` | Someone is attempting to close a gap. A resource is being offered to restore balance. |
| `event` | People are gathering to work on alignment — to act, to organize, to show up together. |
| `informative` | A fact about the state of things. Ground truth about conditions as they are. |

An `ask` is a declaration of misalignment — "we need food pantry volunteers" means the distance between what this community needs and what it has is nonzero. A `give` is an attempt to close that distance — "free legal clinic Tuesday" means someone is actively working to restore balance.

The system doesn't define what alignment looks like. The organizations on the ground already did that by broadcasting. The system just makes their declarations findable.

## The Feedback Loop

The architecture contains a natural feedback loop that requires no engagement metrics, no tracking, and no credit-taking:

```
Tension exists in the world
  → Organizations feel it, broadcast asks and gives
    → System collects signals, clusters form
      → Findings surface the pattern ("here's what's producing these signals")
        → People see it, engage, show up
          → Need gets addressed
            → Asks decrease, gives plateau
              → Finding velocity drops → declining → resolved
                → System reflects the new state
```

The system is a pressure gauge with a release valve. The gauge is signal collection. The release valve is human engagement. When people act on what the system surfaces, the pressure drops — and the system reflects that naturally, because the asks stop coming.

This is not measured in a vacuum. The system doesn't know *why* signals decreased — whether people engaged through this platform, through word of mouth, through a thousand other channels. It doesn't need to know. It measures the world's state, not its own impact. When the condition changes, the signals change. That's enough.

## The Neuron Metaphor

Signals fire like neurons. Most fire and are useful on their own — a food pantry posting hours, a cleanup event next Saturday. They live in Layer 1 and serve people directly. No deeper processing needed.

But some signals cross a threshold:

- **Single-signal trigger:** Crisis language, causal framing, emergency tone from a normally calm entity. One neuron fires hard enough to demand attention.
- **Cluster trigger:** A dozen normal signals in the same area in the same week, when the baseline is two. No individual neuron was alarming, but the pattern of firing reveals something.

When the threshold is crossed, an investigation follows — the system's nervous system tracing the signal to its source. The investigation gathers evidence. If the evidence is sufficient and explicitly grounded, a Finding names the pattern.

The Finding is the brain's conclusion: "here's what's producing this cluster of signals." It doesn't judge the pattern. It names it, cites the evidence, and links the signals that converge on it.

## Why It's Honest

Most systems that surface problems create a negativity treadmill — the feed always shows what's wrong, engagement means doom-scrolling, and nothing changes. This architecture avoids that because:

**Asks are inherently actionable.** They're not "look how bad things are." They're "here's what you can do." The signal *is* the invitation to participate.

**Resolution is visible.** When asks stop clustering, the Finding declines. The system doesn't keep amplifying a problem that's been addressed. It gets quiet in that area. The quiet is the signal that alignment was restored.

**The system measures the world, not itself.** It doesn't track whether someone clicked, volunteered, or donated through the platform. The organizations' broadcasts are the measurement. If the church stops posting "we need rent relief volunteers," the need was either met or the condition changed. Either way, the system reflects reality.

**No engagement incentive exists.** The system has no reason to keep a Finding alive longer than the evidence supports. Signal velocity is mechanical — new signals arrive or they don't. There is no algorithm that benefits from sustained tension.

## The Individual Decides What Alignment Means

"Company X has a $50M ICE contract" is a fact. One person reads that and boycotts. Another reads it and invests. The system doesn't care. It surfaced the fact. Its job is done.

This is what keeps the alignment machine honest. The system doesn't define what alignment is. It surfaces pressure points — where asks are concentrating, where gives are forming, where informative signals reveal conditions — and lets individuals decide what's out of balance based on their own values.

The alignment is personal, not systemic. The system has no opinion about what the world should look like. It has a complete picture of what organizations and institutions are broadcasting about what the world *does* look like. The gap between those two — between what is and what someone believes should be — is the space where individual agency lives.

## The Mycorrhizal Network, Fully Realized

The founding metaphor was mycorrhizal networks — underground fungal systems that connect trees, transmitting chemical signals so the forest can adapt to threats. Root Signal was built on this metaphor: collect broadcasts, make them findable, let communities adapt.

The alignment machine is the metaphor fully realized. The network doesn't just transmit signals — it reveals where the forest is stressed, grows toward the stress, and reflects when the stress resolves. Trees don't coordinate consciously. They respond to chemical signals. The forest's health is an emergent property of individual trees acting on local information.

Root Signal works the same way. Organizations broadcast. People respond. The system reflects the state. No central authority decides what matters. No algorithm prioritizes one tension over another. The alignment of the community is an emergent property of individuals acting on the signal they encounter.

The system didn't set out to be an alignment machine. It set out to be a broadcast index. But when you faithfully index asks and gives — declarations of what's missing and what's offered — alignment detection is what emerges. The architecture is right because the emergent behavior is right.
