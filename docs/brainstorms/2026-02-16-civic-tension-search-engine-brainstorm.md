# Civic Tension Search Engine

## What We're Building

A civic platform that raises signal from noise across the entire web, organized around tension. Tension could be civic, environmental, economic — anything. The system detects that something is happening, investigates why, and surfaces everything connected to it — including ways to be civically involved.

Think of it as a **search engine for civic engagement**. The web already contains all the information — food drives, protests, GoFundMes, boycotts, mutual aid, org events, individual efforts — but it's scattered across news sites, social media, event pages, fundraising platforms, government filings, and more. Taproot brings it all into one civic platform.

## Core Concept

The system is an organism with three functions:

1. **Detect** tension (anywhere you point it)
2. **Investigate** it (why is it happening, what caused it, what's connected)
3. **Surface** ways to be civically involved (from anyone responding, at any scale)

That's it. Everything else emerges naturally from the data.

## Key Principles

- **Tension-first.** You navigate by what's happening, not by who's doing what.
- **The city (or region, or place) is the protagonist**, not the user's preferences.
- **Not a matchmaker.** The system curates and structures. Humans decide for themselves what to do.
- **Anyone can be a responder.** Organizations, grassroots groups, individuals with a GoFundMe, someone with a van. No hierarchy of legitimacy.
- **Don't overdefine.** Categories of tension, scopes of action, types of responders — these patterns emerge from the data. Don't design them in.
- **Geographic but not limited.** Punch in a zip code and see tension around that point. Zoom into another state to help remotely. Some actions you can take from your couch.

## The AI's Role

**Civic editor + web crawler.** Sifts signal from noise across the entire web. Organizes, deduplicates, contextualizes. Investigates the *why* behind tension — what's causing it, what organizations are connected, what the history is.

Does NOT matchmake or recommend. It curates and structures so humans can make their own decisions.

## Views

- **Feed** — what's happening, flowing chronologically
- **Map** — geographic grounding of tension, clusters of activity
- **AI Summary** — synthesized narrative of what's going on

All three views into the same underlying data.

## The User

A civically curious person who doesn't know where to start. Doesn't even know what questions to ask. Wants to be engaged but the information is scattered across 50 tabs and buried in algorithmic feeds that don't care about civic engagement.

They open Taproot, they see tension, they explore what's connected, and they find their own on-ramp.

## Examples of Tension

- ICE raids increasing in a neighborhood → who's offering legal aid, know-your-rights trainings, mutual aid
- Toxic spill → what company, what's the environmental impact, who's responding, what can I boycott
- School closings → what policy caused it, who voted for it, who's organizing, how to contact reps
- Food insecurity rising → food drives this Saturday, donation links, orgs accepting volunteers
- Housing crisis → mutual aid, GoFundMes, protests, policy actions

## What This Is NOT

- Not a social network
- Not a matchmaker or recommendation engine
- Not organization-first (orgs are just one type of responder)
- Not limited to one category of tension
- Not passive — the point is to surface ways to ACT, not just inform

## Open Questions

- What are the first data sources to crawl?
- How does the AI determine what constitutes "tension" vs. normal activity?
- How do we handle misinformation / verify legitimacy of responses?
- What's the MVP scope that proves this works?
