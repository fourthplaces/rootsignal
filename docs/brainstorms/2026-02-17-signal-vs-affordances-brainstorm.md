# Signal vs. Affordances: What Root Signal Is and Isn't

## Why This Document Exists

During brainstorming around anti-fragile signal design, a useful distinction emerged: the difference between what Root Signal *is* (a signal utility) and the ways it can be *used* (affordances). This document captures that distinction to keep the core system focused.

Root Signal's identity is already well-defined in the vision docs. It is a **signal utility** — infrastructure that concentrates civic signal and makes it findable (see `docs/vision/problem-space-positioning.md`). This document clarifies what sits on top of that infrastructure.

## The Core System

Root Signal captures snapshots of civic reality, lets patterns emerge through triangulation, and surfaces those patterns. That's it. Everything else is an affordance.

The system has three jobs:

1. **Capture atoms** — observable, timestamped, geolocated snapshots of what organizations and individuals publicly said or did. Anchored to Evidence nodes (URL + content hash). No source is trusted. Every atom is a record of behavior, not a claim about truth.

2. **Let patterns emerge** — triangulation across signal types (Events, Gives, Asks, Notices, Tensions) reveals the shape of reality. Echo (many sources saying the same thing) is weak. Triangulation (many types of activity converging on the same reality) is strong. See `docs/brainstorms/2026-02-17-anti-fragile-signal-brainstorm.md`.

3. **Surface proxies** — individuals who have voluntarily chosen to be public-facing for causes. The system amplifies their existing signal. It never traces back to the organizations they protect.

These three jobs align with the existing principles:

- **Signal Is a Public Good** (Principle #1) — the atoms are public civic signal, freely accessible
- **Emergent Over Engineered** (Principle #13) — patterns arise from graph structure, not hand-coded features
- **Privacy as a Structural Guarantee** (Principle #5) — public civic voice flows freely; private content is never touched
- **Serve the Signal, Not the Algorithm** (Principle #4) — no engagement optimization, just signal served straight

## What an Affordance Is

An affordance is a way of making the signal useful to humans. The underlying system doesn't change — only the presentation layer does. Different audiences, contexts, and crises may call for different affordances.

The system produces signal. Affordances decide how to present it.

This maps to the existing architecture: Root Signal is the layer between fragmented signal sources and people who want to act (see the diagram in `docs/vision/problem-space-positioning.md`). Affordances are the surfaces through which people interact with that layer.

## Possible Affordances

These are outputs the system could provide. None of them ARE the system.

### Pattern View

The system clusters signals and surfaces the shape of what's happening: where activity is concentrating, what types of signal are present, how they triangulate. This makes civic reality legible without editorializing. The system surfaces the pattern and the evidence. The human interprets the meaning.

This is distinct from "news" — the system does not take positions, generate narratives with a point of view, or editorialize (per Principles & Values: "Root Signal will not take political positions" and "it does not editorialize"). Pattern summaries generated by LLM are descriptions of what the graph contains, not stories about what it means.

### Crisis Map

Geographic visualization of signal density and type. Shows where activity is concentrated. Heat maps for different signal types (where are the Asks? where are the Gives?). Respects geographic fuzziness for sensitive signals per the existing safety architecture.

### Mutual Aid Router

Surfaces what's needed (Asks) alongside what's available (Gives, Events). Connects people who want to help with proxies on the ground. The "last mile" is always human-to-human contact — the system gets you to the door, a human opens it.

### Proxy Amplification

Individuals who are already broadcasting, already public. The system amplifies their signal above the noise of algorithmic feeds that weren't designed for civic signal. Links them to the triangulated context around them so their voice carries evidence, not just volume.

### Open API

Raw signal for other systems to consume. Enables third parties to build their own affordances. Could feed into existing civic infrastructure. This is the "utility" nature of Root Signal fully realized — like a water main that any building can connect to.

### Gap View

Where signal types are missing. If an area has Tensions and Asks but no Gives or Events, that's an unmet need. If Gives exist but no corresponding Asks, resources may not be reaching the people who need them. The absence of signal is itself signal.

### Community Mirror

Shows a community what's actually happening around them. Counters the narrative vacuum left when media moves on. Not "here's what you should think" but "here's what organizations and individuals in your area are publicly doing and saying right now."

## The Principle

When designing Root Signal, always ask: **is this part of the signal system, or is it an affordance?**

- If it's the system: it should be about capturing, triangulating, and surfacing signal
- If it's an affordance: it should be about presenting signal in a way that's useful for a specific audience or context

Don't let any single affordance define what the system is. The system is the atoms, the triangulation, and the proxies. Everything else is a lens.

This aligns with the existing decision framework (Principles & Values): "Does this serve the signal or serve the platform?" Affordances serve people. The system serves the signal.
