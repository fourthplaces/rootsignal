[00:00] Okay, can you continue, please?

[00:05] So, you're helping Church A. You got plugged in. What's the... Tell me more.

[00:14] Are you there?

[00:18] Hello, Volunteer A?

[00:30] I didn't even know I lost you.

[00:32] Yeah, I know. So, tell me more. Okay, so you got plugged into Church A. Tell me more.

[00:37] So, kind of taking a step back, when the whole thing started, a lot of these things were posted on Instagram because that was the only way of communicating. And so, Church A was one church that kept getting posted and I wanted to get involved right away. So, I reached out to them, got different certifications, making sure I wasn't... So, I knew I wasn't an imposter. And then I was part of their group chat.

[01:06] And then Church A was really great is they actually help other churches too. And so, they sent a message out saying, hey, there's another church called Church B that needs support also. So, I ended up reaching out to them and now I'm kind of a go-to for that church.

[01:24] So, when it comes to, like, funds, like, they're doing... They're supporting roughly 90 families. They have... What's really cool about them is they've actually... Only, I think, 30% of their people are actually part of their organization and then the rest, the 70% are actually through different... Just our general community.

[01:46] Okay.

[01:46] So, what I really love about them is they're smaller, they're more intimate than Church A. So, they're actually helping support our Local Daycare because our daycare ladies now need help also and support. Like, they're not even taking the kids outside at this point because they're afraid of ICE.

[02:03] Yeah.

[02:04] And then also, Co-volunteer B and I are supporting roughly four families. So, they've decided to onboard or take them also in. So, they're helping feed them also. So, usually, when I get their box of food, I drop off Neighborhood Coordinator's and Neighborhood Coordinator disperses all the food.

[02:18] And then, it's seriously... A lot of times, like, volunteer opportunities are through, like, social media. So, like, right now, Organization C is suffering a little bit. They need actual, like, physical donations, money donations, but actual volunteers also.

[02:30] Right.

[02:32] But a lot of it's been through kind of word of mouth.

[02:36] And then, I know that's, like, Church B. I'm pretty much one of the coordinators. I turned into one of the coordinators with the pastor, but also the guy in operations.

[02:48] So...

[02:48] Okay. Why aren't they posting on social media?

[02:51] They're worried about ICE.

[02:54] Everything is very private. So, even with Church A, they keep saying, they keep reminding us, like, don't copy and paste your messages to other people. Like, don't... don't share this information if they're not part of this group chat. They're just really worried about ICE, finding out their location.

[03:10] So, Church B is kind of keeping things on the download because they don't want ICE to show up at their church and create more fear because then that creates more people not wanting to physically go there and help or assist, whatever it is.

[03:23] Right.

[03:24] So, Church B, even to create a GoFundMe, they're a bit fearful of it because they didn't want ICE to find out. But since it's in my name...

[03:32] Right.

[03:33] I am the target, not the church.

[03:37] Got it.

[03:39] Yeah, it's mainly just ICE. They're worried about ICE.

[03:41] Understood. So, let me get this straight because I think the thing that I'm just trying to understand clearly is you understand the paradox here. I just want to point this out. You understand the paradox if there's no visibility. If everything's private, then how does anybody know to actually help, like, what's going on in Minnesota or to help these churches?

[06:19] Yeah, word of mouth.

[06:20] Word of mouth. Well, that's, I mean, but if you need help from other states, it's just kind of, so it's all word of mouth. It's all sort of, like, one-to-one, you're telling me.

[06:29] Yeah, so, like, for example, I told Volunteer A's Partner's family about, like, Church B and so they have a church in [city] that they're trying to reach out to, but it's also about reaching out to these large organizations. Like, I know that Fresh Thyme, Hy-Vee, and Costco will give donations to nonprofits, and so it's about us doing our work also and actually signing up for these donations individually, too.

[07:01] I want to point out another sense that I have. It's these organizations that you're protecting. Is that correct?

[07:08] Yep, 100%.

[07:09] And so, got it. You don't have a problem posting on social media, correct?

[07:15] No.

[07:16] Got it. And so, really, it's, it's, if there's visibility in terms of what you are broadcasting, for example, you would be keen on, you would be keen on doing that. If you had a place that had high signal for these specific causes, people would get in contact with you directly.

[07:38] Yep. And that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm posting every day about, like, this church every single day, and I'm posting every day on Facebook pretty much. Actually, every other day on Facebook.

[07:50] Okay.

[07:51] Just to create visibility, I'm like, you know, if they're afraid of, like, ICE, like, I'm a [demographic] living in my house, so, like, how much of a threat am I? And so, I'm okay with putting myself out there to protect others.

[08:07] I see. That's why I have been posting every day pretty much on Instagram.

[08:10] Got it. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. And so, basically, you're like, hey, reach out to me, and you're the go-to person. You're kind of, like, you're willing to take on the heat, and you're kind of, like, the go-to person for these organizations.

[08:28] Pretty much, yeah. So that ICE does not show up at, like, daycare centers, for example, and scare people who are, like, genuinely trying to help.

[08:37] Yep.

[08:38] And they were, and I'm repeating this back to you, they were clear in saying, don't share this because we don't want ICE coming and ruining our operation.

[08:47] Yep, and also they don't want people to follow so they know what certain pickup times are.

[08:52] Uh-huh.

[08:53] For groceries, for example, they don't want ICE following you to drop off.

[08:56] Got it. Okay, cool. I mean, understood. Good. So really, what's happening here is there's too much noise. There's not enough signal, I think, for you to really, I mean, I, so there's, it's, there's the one-on-one, but the real optimal way to get it out there is if other people actually had visibility into what's actually going on in Minnesota.

[09:22] Yeah.

[09:22] And right now, that's why they call it, like, there's a lot of underground, there's a lot of underground systems happening.

[09:29] Like, the fact that a family member does laundry for that family is considered a big underground operation in a way. And the fact that, like, I'm doing deliveries to daycare is considered a big underground operation.

[09:41] Right.

[09:41] Like, that's why there's so many underground operations is because it's just that fear of ICE.

[09:45] Well, it's not illegal. I think the, the real tension point that I'm getting from you is that I, you don't want ICE, the real wrinkle, the real problem here is ICE intimidating these organizations.

[09:59] Yeah.

[09:59] And so, it's, it's really, it's, but individuals, it's fine. It's just kind of like, I'm not doing anything wrong. In fact, I'm doing exactly what needs to get done. I'm helping these people.

[10:07] And so, this is where it sounds like individuals are stepping up and jumping in. And what you're trying to do right now is find more individuals who are willing just to kind of stand up and say, I'm going to do what's right and I'm going to step forward and I'm going to, and so what you're doing too is you're also vetting people, I'm guessing, right?

[10:31] Yeah.

[10:32] Okay. So, that seems really important. So, this is a world trust based type thing. You're almost kind of like a recruiter in a sense.

[10:40] Yeah. Yep.

[10:41] Okay. I think I understand what the problem, I understand this. I think the thing that I've been trying to figure out right now is that, and here's the problem that I'm seeing right now, there's too much fucking noise.

[10:54] Yeah.

[10:54] And, and the news was so quick to move on to the next thing.

[10:59] I know, right?

[11:00] It seems like, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is still, this is some shit that's still going on. We still need, like, attention.

[11:08] And, and this is what, a month ago?

[11:11] Yeah.

[11:12] So, and that's why, like, for example, like, the fact that, like, a family member is being burnt out, for example.

[11:18] Yes. By the way, [aside].

[11:21] That's why, like, I was like, hey, Church B is now going to cover the groceries for these families. And family member was like, okay, good. And so now I get the delivery for groceries.

[11:31] Okay.

[11:32] And she only does the laundry right now.

[11:34] Got it. Pretty much.

[11:36] Understood.

[11:38] But, yeah. I don't know, just, we need, the biggest thing, like, I'm saying on Instagram, which I agree is, like, don't give up, like, they're still, like, they just recently moved in a fleet of new cars.

[11:49] Yeah.

[11:50] In the [area]. And, like, it's not ending.

[11:54] And, like, they're just using different tactics, like.

[11:58] And it's the, and it's the, right. And so, I hear you.

[12:04] Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So here's another thing that Volunteer A's Partner and I are doing.

[12:08] Okay.

[12:08] There's a daycare worker that, in a way, like, got laid off because there's not, there's not enough kids in the daycare for her to be there. And so her name's Daycare Worker and she's like, I don't know how I'm gonna, her husband's not working because he has a green card. He doesn't want to leave. And so she was the only one working, hurting all the bills.

[12:29] And so I told her, I was like, hey, we'll still drop off groceries to your house. So once we drop off the groceries to daycare, we'll then go to her house and drop food off. And so like, and it's just an ongoing thing. Like, I know Volunteer A's Partner is actually bringing his trailer over to Church A to pick up 50 boxes of food and then he's gonna pick up another 50 on Thursday. And then that's where we need bodies to kind of help.

[12:52] But the thing is, they don't, Church B Operations Lead doesn't trust anyone. And so I more or less, if people say, hey, I know Volunteer A and it has to be via text. You can't, you can't call Church B Operations Lead. Then he'll say, okay, cool. You can come and help. But like, if you don't say like, I know so-and-so or I came from Church A or I know Volunteer A, Church B Operations Lead doesn't want you to help.

[13:12] Totally.

[13:12] Or the church either.

[13:13] No, no, I get you. And this is where you're being protective and vetting people because, yeah, you've had, I've heard of some people kind of going, yeah, I want to help. And then they're just, they're going in just to like, expose everything.

[13:28] Yep.

[13:28] So, so you do need to, you do need the, these gates. You do need to like, check someone out. You do need to say, hey, look, can we actually trust you?

[13:38] And, it's really high trust, you know, and you're being, you're being extra protective. So good on, good on all of you guys for doing that.

[13:46] Yeah, it is hard because like, you're being protective, but at the same time, like, no one knows Church B. Everyone knows of Church A because they did a really good job at promoting themselves in the beginning. But like, no one knows these extra churches. Like, even Volunteer C is helping a church that hasn't even started things yet, but there's, they're helping like, 12 families, I think.

[14:04] Okay.

[14:04] But they have no idea how they want to go about it.

[14:06] And no one knows these extra churches that are helping.

[14:11] So, and this is, this is the, right, and this is, this is the thing I'm really curious about right now is who needs help and how do you get it, how do you, how do you help with, how, who needs help and how do you help them?

[14:25] How do you create visibility while protecting, their operation?

[14:32] Yeah.

[14:32] And so, like Volunteer C, for example, reached out and Volunteer C is like, hey, I'm going to be in Minnesota for a week. Where can I help out? And I gave her a ton of options because every organization is doing something different weekly.

[14:45] Right.

[14:45] And so I was like, hey, Organization C is offering this, Church A is offering this, Church B is offering this. I'm like, but if you want to do your own thing, my friend, Neighborhood Coordinator, is accepting groceries to distribute in her neighborhood. So I gave Volunteer C a ton of options so that she could choose from it.

[15:03] But I think people just want a variety of options. They don't want to feel like, they want to give back, but no one knows how to give back either. I'm noticing.

[15:14] Well, and that's, that's, that's another thing too. It's kind of like, I want to help, but I don't know how.

[15:19] Yeah.

[15:19] And it's all, it's all so fragmented right now. And the issue, and you have a lot of forces working against this. I mean, the main one being so much noise and none of it is important. And it's just kind of like, boy, I mean, and so, no, I, I, I get it. And, and it's so overwhelming. It is so fragmented.

[15:41] It is. And I kind of find myself in that position too, kind of going, whoa, it's just like, I want to jump in and there's really no resources for me to easily do that. Easily jump in. Easily find.

[15:53] Because it's secretive.

[15:55] Well, it needs to be. It needs to be.

[15:57] Yeah. It needs to be. Yeah.

[15:58] Like, another thing is, I guess for me, I've kind of found my lane. Like, for example, Mondays is like my chill day. Tuesdays, I volunteer. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I volunteer. Fridays, I go to Neighborhood Coordinator's. And then Saturdays are my like me days.

[16:19] Right.

[16:20] Okay. Only even to pick up groceries. And that's just what we've been doing for almost, a month and a half now.

[16:31] Right. I would say.

[16:32] Right.

[16:34] And so I've kind of found a groove that works. And like, for example, if you ever want to help with this, there's another guy that owns a grocery store and he's suffering. And so what he's been doing is he's been actually using his own grocery store to deliver free food for free. And he's like in Minneapolis near [neighborhood]. And I reached out to him. I'm like, hey, how can I support? And he said, seriously, if you can come by and buy some groceries, that would be helpful.

[17:05] Right.

[17:05] And so, because they have to keep their business afloat. And so, I mean, we need to go by for the past two weeks, but I've been sick.

[17:14] But hopefully this week I can stop by at his market.

[17:17] Yeah. No, no, no. Like little things like that. Or like, I know on Wednesday, Volunteer A's Partner and I are going to go out to eat. We're going to go on a date. And there's this, there's this organization and they sponsor restaurants in need, but they don't even tell you 24 hours in advance which restaurant it is. And it's a, it's an event from four to seven. And they do like printing also.

[17:43] But we don't even know what restaurant we're going to go to on Wednesday. Until we'll find out, we'll find out today where it is. But like, there's little things like that happening too.

[17:51] Right. No, I get you.

[17:53] And so, okay. Yeah. Well, thanks for sharing all that because it's really helpful in what I'm trying to do and how I'm trying to pitch in in my own way with my own skills because this is an enormous problem.

[18:09] And a lot of people are, it's like, you got a whole bunch of people that are able and willing and want to jump in and don't know how, don't know where, don't know the Volunteer A's of the world, don't know who to trust. And this creates a problem too because it's like, you're not seeing churches talk about it because it's like, like you said, it's all word of mouth.

[18:30] Yeah.

[18:31] So, there are a number of issues that I'm seeing here. And I think I have a sense about the problem. And so, this is something that I'm just exploring right now actively.

[18:47] Yeah.

[18:47] So, can you talk to Volunteer C about this kind of stuff too?

[18:49] I'm going to talk to her today about it.

[18:52] Okay. How is she doing?

[18:53] I don't know. I don't know. I think she's good.
